    "* For depositing single cells (~50 pL), about 2-5 cell containing droplets can be deposited at a time\n",

By viewing the relative amounts of fluorescence, real-time single-cell data can be collected on the fitness of different DIP sequences. There is also added flexibility from being able to add two or more cells to the droplet to view possible co-infection?"
