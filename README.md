As per UCSF electronic lab notebook protocol, the Andino Laboratory owns this notebook.

The three aspects of the Poliovirus Defective Interfering Particle (DIP) project encapsulated are:
1) **Single-cell microfluidic dynamics image processing and analysis.**
The data is collected from the printed microfluidics setup, in collaboration with the Abate lab.
Ideally, there will be a series of experiments
* As of 2018-07-24, cells are not able to be happily inserted into droplets (they die or are in
low abundance). All processing and analysis is of test data and is for the development of the pipeline.
2) **Mouse model video processing and analysis.**
Mice models of infection/co-infection are analyzed through image analysis. Ultimately, this processing
and analysis pipeline will be able to detect the 'dragging' of rear limbs due to Polio progression.
This processing and analysis will complement the work done by Simone Bianco's group at IBM.
3) **Evolutionary Fitness of Poliovirus Mutants**
Analysis of CirSeq data collected from serial passaging of both the WT Poliovirus and DIP.
Eventually this pipeline will merge with the analysis of single-cell microfluidics via DropSeq.
